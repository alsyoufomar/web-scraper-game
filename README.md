## About

It is a game like Minesweeper and your job is to scrape data from all websites _cells_ except Facebook's _cells_. Use a **_Left click_** to scrape and a **_Right click_** to bookmark Facebook so you can avoid it. This is an SPA, implemented with vanilla JS (History API) using the `http-server-spa` npm package to get the spa routing functionality of an SPA.
This package is similar to `http-server`, but allows us to fall back to serving up `index.html` if a route does not match any resource on the server. This behaviour is the usual behaviour of a single page application, otherwise, if you tried to refresh the page it will give you "page not found", which is an undesirable behaviour.
